    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These delicious grilled lamb chops are easy to prep with a flavorsome garlic and onion marinade before they're cooked on the grill for tender, juicy results.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>6 (6 ounce) lamb chops</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine onion, vinegar, oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add lamb chops; coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove lamb from marinade and leave any onions on that are sticking to the chops; discard marinade. Wrap exposed ends of bones with aluminum foil to keep them from burning.</li>
        <li>Cook lamb chops on the preheated grill until grill marks appear and to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
